Nick's Food Log Request for Today (2025-07-18)

Items consumed:
1. Banana blueberry protein shake (usual - already in database)
2. About half a tablespoon of Justin's brand honey peanut butter  
3. Single square of chocolate from Endangered Species 72% chocolate bar
   - Note: One square is 1/3 of a row, and there are 7 rows in the bar
   - So this is approximately 1/21 of the whole bar
4. About half cup of whole raw milk
5. Four hard boiled eggs
6. Quarter cup of quark cheese

Notes:
- The protein shake recipe should already exist in the database
- Will need to search for the other ingredients via Nutritionix API
- Serving sizes are estimated and may need conversion from weight/volume to standard servings
- Justin's honey peanut butter is a specific brand that should be searchable
- Endangered Species chocolate is also a specific brand
- Quark cheese might need alternative search terms if not found directly
